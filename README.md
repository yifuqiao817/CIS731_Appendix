Project: Movie Evaluating System based on sentiment analysis, using a combination model of CNN and LSTM


More code on CIS731 term project
The code of CIS731_YifuQiao_Implementation_modeltraining.py has some revision on training method, adding two cases of model comparison. 

The code of CIS_731_Project_Scoring.py is a new case that has tried to build a LSTM-CNN scoring model based on IMDb online data. 


The data required to run these two codes are in the submission of my implementation. 

Thank you very much!
